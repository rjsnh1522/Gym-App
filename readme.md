## Gym App.

You can't manage what you can't measure.

To build muscle you need to do many things like, your diet should be right, your workout should be optimized and you must to progressive overload.

This app I am building is to track your weekly progress.
This app is in two parts, a mobile app, written in React Native. and the backend is in FastAPI.


This is the backend of my gym app.
